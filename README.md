# BadBank - Express-Mongo-Firebase

Description

Welcome to my BadBank application. BankBank because it had no security.
Over the past couple weeks I have started adding security using Firebase authentication and authorization. 

This Badbank application was created to make people aware of the different types of securities you can implement
within your website. What could be weak / strong security. Do you even have security? 
How can the customer be protected.

What the application entails: 

- BadBank landing page.
- Create an account.
- Login.
- Deposit.
- Withdraw.
- Balance.
- Data of users that have been registered.

Dependencies:

- npm init.
- npm install cors.
- npm install express.
- npm install mongodb.
- npm install lowdb.
- npm i firebase.

Using Firebase:
- Create an account.
- Click on "Go to console", on the top right corner.
- Create a project.
- Enter your project name and create your project.
- Head over to Project overview and then select project settings.
- Add a web application but clicking on the blue </> button.
- Register you app and add your apps name.

- If you go to project settings and scroll down the page you will be able to access your firebaseConfig information.
- When using Firebase you can login by using "firebase login" in your terminal.

Using authentication and authorization from Firebase:
- Click on the authentication tab.
- Click on "Set up sing-in method".
- Enable Email/Password.

Backend authentication and authorization from Firebase:
- Project settings.
- Go into service accounts.
- Generate a new private key
- (If wanting to use a generated private key you will need to update your FirebaseConfig information as it changes when generating a key)
 
[NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY]
