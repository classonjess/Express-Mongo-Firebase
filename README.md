# BadBank - Express-Mongo-Firebase

Description

Welcome to my BadBank application. BankBank becuase it had no security.
Over the past couple weeks I have started adding security using Firebase authentication and authorization. 

This Badbank application was created to make people aware of the diffrent types of securities you can implement
within your website. What could be weak / strong security. Do you even have secuity? 
How can the customer be protected.
